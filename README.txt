(1)When I synthesize my design, I meet a warning: (WARNING: [Synth 8-7080] Parallel synthesis criteria is not met). I search the Xilinx official website. They explain that this warning indicates that the design is not large enough to benefit from parallel synthesis(https://support.xilinx.com/s/article/72150?language=en_US). The explanation seems to mean the warning is not caused by my design.
(2)My testbench cannot stop automatically after finishing. Therefore, you need to stop manually. My testbench finishes at 6000 ns.
